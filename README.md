# Dog-Gone_cute - Front End Edition

# Deployed Site
https://bdiveley.github.io/dog_gone_cute_fe/

# Introduction
Dog-Gone-Cute is a front-end JavaScript/node.js application that consumes APIs from a public API (https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/) and a backend Rails API that I created (https://github.com/bdiveley/dog_gone_cute).  The combined applications provide a fun way to waste a few hours by rating the cuteness level of randomly selected dogs.  You can search random dog pictures based on a specific breed, nor breed at all, or based on their cuteness level.  You may also rate the cuteness level of these random dog pictures.
